Pinetrail depends on various libraries and web services to perform its tasks.

The correction of the elevation data relies on the excellent web service kindly
provided by [MapQuest](http://www.mapquest.com/) under very generous terms for
third-party developers.

The reverse geo-coding functionality also relies on the web service from
MapQuest, which itself is based on the excellent Nominatim tool provided by
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org).

The [Movable Type web site](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/) from Chris Veness is
a trove of high quality information and code for geodesic distance calculations.

Thank you also go to Steve Fry and Dick Holley, for their formul√¶ to
estimate the difficulty of a trail depending on the hiker's level.

Special thanks also to @Tzaphkiel for the additional test cases and his
always highly appreciated code reviews!

Last but not least, this project relies on open source Java libraries and I
would like to express my gratitude to their authors for making their high
quality Java code available to the public:
- [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/), the Simple Logging Facade for Java;
- [Hibernate Validator](http://hibernate.org/validator/), to express validation
rules in a standardized way using annotation-based constraints.
- [Common Maths](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/), the Apache
Commons Mathematics Library;
- [Java classes for the GPX schemas](https://github.com/GCRC), kindly provided
by the Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre from the Carleton University
in Ottawa;
- [ARGS4J](http://args4j.kohsuke.org/), the Java command line arguments parser.
