# Roadmap

Work items (bug fixes, improvements to existing features and implementation of
new features) are documented on the
[issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/sosna/pinetrail/issues).

In a nutshell, the priorities for the next release are:

- To provide a Java FX **graphical user interface** so that people not
comfortable with using a command line interface can also use the software;

- To add **support for additional formats** as, currently, the only supported
format is GPX 1.1. Candidates:
  - GPX 1.0
  - KML
  - NMEA

- ~~To add the possibility to convert the GPS track (i.e. an ordered collection
of points, with time information, recorded by a GPS tracking unit or logger)
into a **route** (i.e. an ordered collection of points leading to a
destination), which is useful if you want to share your itinerary with others.~~
